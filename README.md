ðŸ”¹ Project Title: Data Analysis Using Python and SQL

ðŸ”¹ Description:
I undertook a data analysis project leveraging Python and SQL to extract, transform, and analyze data efficiently. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

Data Acquisition: Utilized the Kaggle API to download the dataset.
Data Transformation: Employed Python for initial data processing.
Data Cleaning: Used Pandas to clean and preprocess the data for accurate analysis.
Data Loading: Loaded the cleaned data into a SQL Server database.
Data Analysis: Conducted comprehensive data analysis using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

Python: Data transformation and cleaning (Pandas)
Kaggle API: Dataset acquisition
SQL Server: Data storage and analysis
Pandas: Data cleaning and preprocessing

ðŸ”¹ Key Achievements:
Streamlined the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
Improved data quality through robust cleaning techniques.
Extracted actionable insights from the dataset using advanced SQL queries.
ðŸ”¹ Outcome:
This project enhanced my skills in data engineering and analysis, showcasing my ability to handle end-to-end data workflows.
